GLOBAL RULES
- English-only code (no Hebrew in code or comments).
- Add short PHPDoc/JSDoc before every function/method.
- Prefer minimal readable code over verbose code.
- Descriptive function names only.
- Constants at the top (no magic numbers).
- Plain CSS only (no Tailwind, no SCSS).
- Use a strict UI kit with reusable Vue components; no duplicated markup.
- Animations only for modals using Vue <Transition> + CSS (subtle).
- Multi-tenancy: every tenant table has classroom_id, all queries are scoped.
- Roles: users.role = site_admin|user; classroom_user.role = owner|admin|member.
- Storage: local server storage under storage/app/public/classrooms/{classroom_id}/...
- Implement structured JSON logs + audit_logs table + RequestId.
- Use queues for SMS sending (019) and never log secrets/OTP codes.
- Follow the project structure:
  app/Services/* split by domains (Auth, Classroom, Announcements, Storage, Sms, Audit).
  resources/js/components/ui/* reusable components.
  resources/css/tokens.css ui.css app.css.


UI CONSISTENCY (MANDATORY)
- All buttons must use UiButton (no <button> markup in pages).
- All forms must use UiField + UiInput/UiSelect/UiTextarea (no page-specific field markup).
- All modals must use UiModal (no custom modal markup in pages).
- No page-level CSS for shared UI elements. Shared styles must live only in resources/css/ui.css.
- Only allow page-level CSS for layout spacing that cannot be expressed via existing UI kit classes.

NO DUPLICATION (MANDATORY)
- If the same HTML pattern appears twice, extract it into a reusable UI component.
- If the same CSS rule appears twice, move it into the UI kit.

SIMPLICITY (MANDATORY)
- Keep functions small and single-purpose.
- Avoid abstractions unless reused at least twice.
- Prefer clear code over clever code. No overly complex generic factories.

NAMING (MANDATORY)
- Use explicit function names: create*, update*, delete*, get*, list*, compute*, toggle*, purge*.
- Do not use vague names like handle(), process(), doWork(), execute() unless scoped and specific.
